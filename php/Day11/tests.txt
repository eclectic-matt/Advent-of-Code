---
Test: divisible by 2
The last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)
---
Test: divisible by 3
Sum the digits. The result must be divisible by 3
---
Test: divisible by 5
The last digit is 0 or 5
---
Test: divisible by 7
Adding 5 times the last digit to the rest gives a multiple of 7
(Works because 49 is divisible by 7)
---
Test: divisible by 11
Subtract the last digit from the rest. The result must be divisible by 11.
---
Test: divisible by 13
Add 4 times the last digit to the rest. The result must be divisible by 13.	
---
Test: divisible by 17
Subtract 5 times the last digit from the rest. 
(Works because 51 is divisible by 17.)
---
Test: divisible by 19
Add 4 times the last two digits to the rest. 
(Works because 399 is divisible by 19.)

19*17*13*11*7*5*3*2

-------
Divisble by 4:
The last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.[2][3]	


The real trick is related to the hint that 
"You'll need to find another way to keep your worry levels manageable." 
Without care, this quickly blows up into slow giant bigints 
after so many round. 
So instead of dividing by three, 
I simply use the product of all of the divisors as a modulus.

const superModulo = monkeys.reduce(
  (prev, monkey) => monkey.test.divisbleBy * prev,
  1
);
